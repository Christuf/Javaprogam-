# Javaprogam-
Using the Java.io file class to retrieve the number of files in a directory.
Replace "path/to/directory" with the actual path to the directory you want to count the number of files in. 
The program uses the listFiles() method to get a list of files and subdirectories in the specified directory.
It then loops through the array of files, incrementing the numFiles counter for each file that is a regular file (not a directory). 
The program finally prints the number of files found in a directory.
